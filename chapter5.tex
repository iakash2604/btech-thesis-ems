\chapter{Future Work}
We have developed the tool for performing observability analysis and state estimation, and a working model of a 14 bus system to test our tool on. 
For building a complete EMS package, which is the end goal, we will incorporate bad data detection, bad data removal, and Optimal Power Flow to built an end to end solution. We plan to complete this whole package by the next semester.
