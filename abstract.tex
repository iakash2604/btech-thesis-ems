With increasing complexities in electrical grids as well as increasing demand for power, it is pertinent that the grid is safely and efficiently maintained. This can be done using an end to end system which can perform an Observability Analysis and State Estimation based on the grid data. This can enable engineers to make better decisions. Such a system has been implemented in a modular, easy to use python package.
